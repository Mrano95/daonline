                        <p>During the studies Off-shore at the Drentse Academie we will focus on different factors that are important for the Off-shore work field. One of the things we will be focussing on is the supply chain. Other things Include the Safety and Behaviour during off-shore work, but also the Maintenance and Operation needed to keep your off-shore projects running. These days there are also plenty of requests for off-shore wind workers, which is why we offer a minor green energy where you will be working on off-shore wind projects. Do you want to put your mechanical engeneering  to practice in a unique location? Then the off-shore studies would be perfect for you!</p>

                        <p>How do you calculate the resistance of a ship. What is the impact of a wave? For those who want answers on those questions, there is the ship-building studies. During your studies you will be focussing on designing, building and repairing ships. These ships will vary between dredgers and off-shore installations to luxury yachts and ferries. You will learn to combine age-old shipbuilding traditions with  modern advanced technologies. Apart from that you will also learn about the business aspects of shipbuilding companies, like finances, organisation and personnel. </p>

                        <p>During your machine building studies you will mostly be woring in the workshop. You will receive  assingments from your teachers. These assignments are based on real-life cases. You will make these assignments based on drawings. You will also help your fellow students with building complex systems, lifts or elements of those lifts and systems on a frame or framework. Apart from that you will also learn to measure, control and test to make sure your machines are safe. This studies is based on practice and the Drentse Academe has a spacious workshop where you can complete all of your assingments </p>

                        <p>The studies steel and construction gives insight in power processing and loads in and on building constructions. You will be taught mathematics and applied mechanics which you can link to practical application in steel construction. This studies uses teachers that used to work in the field themselves. Mechanics is based on mathematics which is why you will firstly gain some knowledge in mathematical designs, goniometry, divers functions and differential and integral calculus. You wil also gain more insight in the technical aspects of steel.</p>
